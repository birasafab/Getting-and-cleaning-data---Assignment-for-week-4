2) Downloading the desired files for assignment
3) unzipping the downloaded data files
4) reading the required text files data from the donwloaded files


## Transformations that I undertaken to make the data set tidy

1) Merging training, test data sets
2) Reading the features data set
3) Renaming columns of the merged data set basing on the features data set index
4) making self explanatory column names to the merged data set

## creating the final tidy data set for submitting to the github repository
1) from the final merged data set with self explanatory named columns, I created a text file containing data which I shared in my github repository
