## Readme file for the assignment on Getting and cleaning data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate learners' ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

### In the assignment, I was requested to provide the following:

1. A tidy data set as named "tidyData"
2. a link to my github repository containing an R script entitled "run_analysis.R" for other learners to be able to review my assignment
3. A coodbook.md file explaining the data set, transformations that I have made to clean the same data set, etc.
4. finally, a README.md file to provide a brief explanation of the files provided and their linkage

### links to the data set for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project are the following:

Here are the data for the project:

### learners were requested to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

These files are solely used for "Getting and Cleaning data assignment" purpose

End.
